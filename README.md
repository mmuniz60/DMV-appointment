# DMV-appointment

#The program I created opens customer data then parses it into a Json file

#Then the tellers take the json data and parse 

#Adding functions to assign a teller 

#Then a series of loops to check cutomer and teller data

#To check if a teller or customer needs to be assigned or available 

#Finally to check if any specalities are required, once all customers have been assigned will display a bool value of True/False

After running the program I relaized 3 things I should've added.

#First Remove customer data 

#Second add time of longest appointment for records

#Third print results of longest teller work duration
